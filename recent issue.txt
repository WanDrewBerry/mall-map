Here’s a quick summary of what we’re working on:
✅ Fixing the delete button for images in MallDetails.tsx
- Moved the ❌ button to each image in the upper section.
- Ensured it only appears for admins.
- Made sure deleted images are properly removed from state (setMall).
✅ Restoring missing photos & reviews
- Mapped data.images correctly to photos.
- Ensured reviews aren't accidentally overwritten in state.
✅ Cleaning up ImageUploader.tsx
